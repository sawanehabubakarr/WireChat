Here are some ideas for JavaScript functionality you could implement:

Toggle Sidebar: Implement JavaScript to toggle the visibility of the sidebar (left side of the container) when clicked on a button or icon. This allows users to hide or show the sidebar based on their preference, especially on smaller screens.

Chat List Interaction: Add JavaScript to handle interactions with the chat list. For example, when a user clicks on a chat, you could display the chat conversation on the right side of the container.

Chat Input: Implement functionality for sending messages. When a user types a message in the input field and presses enter or clicks on a send button, the message should be added to the chat conversation.

Search Functionality: Add JavaScript code to implement search functionality. When a user types in the search input, filter the chat list based on the search query and display relevant chats.

Responsive Design: Ensure your interface is responsive, and elements adjust dynamically based on screen size. JavaScript can help in handling layout changes and adjusting elements accordingly.

Notification Handling: If you have unread messages or notifications, you can use JavaScript to handle the display of unread message counters and update them dynamically as new messages arrive.

Integration with Backend: If you want to create a fully functional chat application, you'll need to integrate JavaScript with a backend server for handling user authentication, storing messages, and delivering them to recipients.
